# ECE4300 Fall 2021 Project

## Python Libraries to Download Beforehand

1. Check if you have pip installed before hand: ***pip -V***
2. Install pip: ***python -m pip install --upgrade pip***
3. Install numpy library: ***pip install numpy***
4. Install openCV Library: ***pip install opencv-python***

I Believe that this is what you need to install, kind reminder that these commands do work for Linux, but I am not sure if they work for windows so I would test it out and you guys are more than welcome to let me know what works and what doesn't.
