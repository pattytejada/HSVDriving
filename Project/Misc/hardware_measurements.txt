Motor Drive Module
Operating mode: H-bridge driver (dual)
Chip: L298N
Logic voltage: 5V
Logic current 0mA-36mA
Drive voltage: 5V-35V
Drive current: 2A (MAX single bridge)
Maximum power: 25W
Dimensions: 43x43x27mm
Wheel Diameter: ~7cm
DC Motor Dimension: ~7cm x ~2cm

Note:
General Application:
When your driver is 7V-12V (Marked as 12V Input), you can use the on-board 5V logic supply.
When using the on-board 5V power supply, do not input voltage at interface 5V Input, but it can
draw 5V voltage for external use.

Unconventional application of high-voltage drive:
When the driving voltage is higher than 12V, less than or equal to 24V. First, the onboard 5V
output enabled jumper cap must be removed, and then connect the 5V external voltage to the
5V Input interface to power the L298N internal logic circuit.

DC Motor
Operating Voltage: 3V ~ 6V DC
Reduction ratio: 1:48
When the voltage is 6V:
No-load current: ≤200mA
No-load speed: 200±10%rpm
When the voltage 3V:
No-load current: ≤150mA
No-load speed: 90±10%rpm
